					Our plumbing system serves as the backbone of AutoAquaponics and facilitates the efficient
					transport of nutrients to the plants. It also removes solid waste and potentially toxic
					contaminants from the fish tank to ensure the health of our fish. AutoAquaponics’ plumbing
					consists of a 100 gallon fish tank, two 40 gallon grow beds, a 60 gallon sump tank, and a
					three-stage filtration system. The filter system includes a settling tank, a membrane
					filtration tank, and a biofilm reactor to convert ammonia from fish waste into nitrate for
					the plants.

					These electronics put the Auto in AutoAquaponics, and allow us to both monitor and control
					the system from anywhere in the world. Our electrical system currently features a smart
					outlet box powered by an ESP32 microcontroller that automatically toggles the lights and
					motorized ball valves in the system, allowing us to flood our two grow beds at different
					intervals and control how much light our plants get. The outlet box also communicates with
					our sensor box via Bluetooth Low Energy. The sensor box contains a Raspberry Pi and a
					number of environmental sensors (pH, TDS, air/water temperature, relative humidity, water
					level) to help us understand the state of the system in real time. The Raspberry Pi pushes
					the sensor data to a remote Firebase database, which can be seen on the Dashboard page.

					AutoAquaponics’ software allows users to monitor and control the system remotely, and it
					uses Python and C++ to run the electronics that interact with our physical system. Our
					platform is built with React and Google Firebase, and it features a live dashboard that
					users can look at to monitor AutoAquaponics’ current state. The graphs are interactive,
					and toggle to display up to 7 days of data at once. Some future developments on the
					software side include creating the Control Panel, Settings, and Video Stream pages.
					Control Panel and Settings will enable people with the appropriate credentials to receive
					automated email/text updates on the system and toggle our smart outlet box to change
					lighting/flooding durations. Video Stream will include a live stream video of our fish
					that anyone can access. Stay tuned for more!

					Biology is an integral part of any farming system, and ours is no exception.
					AutoAquaponics cycles nutrients between aquatic animals, microbes, and plants, all of
					which interact in a symbiotic manner. Food starts out in the fish tank, where it is
					consumed and transformed into solid waste by the fish. This waste gets broken down by the
					heterotrophic bacteria in the filters and turns into ammonia. The ammonia in the water
					then gets captured by the nitrifying microbes, transforming it into nitrite and then
					nitrate. This final product becomes the fertilizer that our plants uptake through their
					roots to make protein and grow. We are currently cultivating wheatgrass, kale, and basil
					in our grow beds, and our fish tank is stocked with tiger barbs, mollies, South American
					cichlids, a Raphael catfish, and a red tailed shark. We also have many invertebrates
					living in the system (ramshorn snails, cherry shrimps, and gammarus pulex) to serve as
					live food sources for the fish.
